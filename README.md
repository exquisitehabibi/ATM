This project demonstrates the integration of Solidity smart contracts with a front-end interface and cryptocurrency wallet, serving as a starting point for those new to DApp development.

## Description

This project serves as a template for building a decentralized application (DApp) that connects a smart contract written in Solidity (Assessment.sol) to a front-end interface (index.js). The project also includes functionality for interacting with a cryptocurrency wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to perform blockchain transactions.

## Getting Started

### Executing program

To run this program, you can use VSCode or online IDEs like Gitpod. To get started, clone this repository using the following cmd in terminal: git clone _url_.

After cloning the github, you will want to do the following to get the code running on your computer.

1. Inside the project directory, in the terminal type: npm i
2. Open two additional terminals in your VS code
3. In the second terminal type: npx hardhat node
4. In the third terminal, type: npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js
5. Back in the first terminal, type npm run dev to launch the front-end.

After this, the project will be running on your localhost. 
Typically at http://localhost:3000/
